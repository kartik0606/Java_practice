//6. Find Third Largest Element in Array
//* Problem: Given an array of distinct integers, find the third-largest elementgeeksforgeeks.org. For example, in [1,14,2,16,10,20], the largest is 20, second is 16, so the third largest is 14.
//        * Why it’s important: This is a further extension of finding the nth-largest element. It tests the candidate’s ability to generalize the approach (e.g. maintaining three top values) or using sorting. It checks attention to detail and handling small n-value ordering.


 public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          int[]arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
         System.out.println(third(arr));

     }

     static  int third(int[]arr){
          int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
          int third = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
          int second  = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
         for (int i = 0; i <arr.length ; i++) {
              if (arr[i]>max){
                   third = second;
                   second  = max;
                   max = arr[i];
              }
              else if (arr[i]>second){
                  third = second;
                  second = arr[i];
               } else if (arr[i] > third) {
                    third = arr[i];
